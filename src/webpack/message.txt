This is a workaround against the fetch polyfill bug that causes source-map package to fallback to the wasm implementation. See https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/blob/0.7.3/lib/read-wasm.js#L1.

This behaviour got fixed in version 0.8.0-beta but reading https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/issues/349#issuecomment-448117131 means this package doesn't want to update to 0.8.0-beta so this one is a simple workaround which got tested in gatsby and seems to work (https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/13713).

Basically this PR just removes global.fetch before loading source-map.
